## Question:
## Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999â€“2008?


# Read PM2.5 emissions dataset
emissions.df <- readRDS('/Users/hamin100/Documents/DataScienceWorkspace/assignment_3/data/summarySCC_PM25.rds')

# Read emission source classification dataset
scc.df <- readRDS('/Users/hamin100/Documents/DataScienceWorkspace/assignment_3/data/Source_Classification_Code.rds')


# Get the coal combustion-related sources
# Use the 'Short.Name' field to find the coal combustion-related sources
scc.coal.df <- scc.df[grep('coal', scc.df$Short.Name), ]

# Get the emissions from coal combustion-related sources
coal.emissions.df <- emissions.df[emissions.df$SCC %in% scc.coal.df$SCC, ]
# Get the total emissions from coal combustion-related sources by year
coal.emissions.by.year.df <- aggregate(Emissions ~ year, data = coal.emissions.df, FUN = sum)
